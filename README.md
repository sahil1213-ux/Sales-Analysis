## Problem Statement
This analysis helps retail businesses understand their sales trends, customer distribution, and promotional impact. It provides insights into the most popular products, total revenue, and regional customer distribution. Businesses can leverage these insights to optimize stock, improve marketing strategies, and maximize revenue.

Additionally, the dashboard provides insights into customer payment preferences, vehicle demand, and ride distances, helping businesses tailor their offerings. Since a notable percentage of rides are either canceled or incomplete, streamlining the booking and driver assignment process can improve reliability.
